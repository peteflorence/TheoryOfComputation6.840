    "\n",
    "Since he wrote the textbook, will not be as much of a focus on taking notes.  The material will appear in the textbook.  Downside is that you don't get a different viewpoint.\n",

    "Sipser: Did programming in high school with cards.  Computers have come a long way since then...  but there are still very fundamental questions about computers that we don't have answers to.\n",

    "In fields that may or may not be related to theories.  There are ideas, a while ago it was expert systems, now it's deep learning.  In chess, through brute force you can get deep enough into the game tree to beat people.  The game of Go has a wider game tree because there are more moves.  In maybe 5 or 10 years, the best player in the world may be a computer.\n",

    "What can you solve with a computer?  What can you do in principle, not worrying about how long it takes.  There are some problems that you just can't solve with a computer.\n",

    "I.e., the P vs. NP problem.\n",

    "The P. vs. NP problem basically asks -- for problems involving search, do you have to search, or can you get around it?\n",

    "In both of these cases, will set the subject up as a mathematical theory.  Things will be formal mathematical objects as a computer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's introduce with a picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine has states\n",
    "\n",
    "Formal Def: A **finite automaton** M is a 5-tuple $(Q, \\Sigma,\\delta,q_0,F)$\n",

    "- Is a \"finite automaton\" synonymous with \"finite state machine\"?\n",
    "- What's the difference between a finite automaton and a directed graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Say M accepts string w if\n",
    "\n",
    "W = $w_1, w_2, ... w_n$ each $w_i \\in \\Sigma$ and if there is a sequence of states $r_0, r_1, ..., r_n \\in Q$ where $r_0 = q_0$ for i = 0,...,n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta(r_i,w_{i+1}) = r_{i+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write down very precisely what it means for the automaton to accept its input.\n",
    "\n",
    "L(M) = language of M = the set of $\\{w \\ | \\ M$ accepts $w\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Every machine has a unique language.  There is always one language of accepted strings.  \"The language that the machine recognizes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "M *recognizes* L(M).\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to understand what kind of languages you can recognize with a finite automaton.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one language for a machine.  It is all the accepted strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An important definition...\n",
    "\n",
    "Def: A language A is **regular** if some finite automaton M recognizes A.  (A = L(M) for some M).\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to read the book and do some practice problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "States are supposed to represent memory in a finite automaton.  A finite automaton is a computer with a limited amount of memory.  You need to count the 1's.  All you need to do is keep track of the even-odd parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-state FSM can be designed to recognize all strings whose sum is even or odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "empty string = $\\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "empty language = $\\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look at some operations on languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations on Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Union  $A \\cup B$ = {w \\ | \\ w \\in A or w \\in B}\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Concatenation  $A \\dot B = AB = {xy | x \\in A, y \\in B}\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Star $A* = \\{w \\ | \\ w = x_1, x_2, x_3 ... _k, \\text{each} x_i \\in A\\}$.  Empty string\n",

    "\n",
    "### Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Built from symbols in the alphabet $\\Sigma, \\epsilon, \\emptyset$\n",
    "\n",
    "$(0 \\cup 1) = \\{0,1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$0(0\\cup 1) = \\{00, 01\\}$\n",

    "\n",
    "$ (0 \\cup 1 $ = all strings over {0,1} = $\\Sigma$*\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are equivalent to finite automata in the set of languages you can describe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thm: If $A_1$, $A_2$ are reguar, so is $A_1 \\cup A_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of saying that is that the regular languages are closed under regular operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be the finite automata that recognize $A_2$ and $A_2$.\n",
